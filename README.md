This is the code repository for [Hands-On Deep Learning with R](https://www.packtpub.com/data/hands-on-deep-learning-with-r?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788996839), published by Packt.

**A practical guide to designing, building, and improving neural network models using R**

## What is this book about?
Deep learning enables efficient and accurate learning from data. Developers working with R will be able to put their knowledge to work with this practical guide to deep learning. The book provides a hands-on approach to implementation and associated methodologies that will have you up-and-running, and productive in no time.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Design a feedforward neural network to see how the activation function computes an output
* Create an image recognition model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
* Prepare data, decide hidden layers and neurons and train your model with the backpropagation algorithm
* Apply text cleaning techniques to remove uninformative text using NLP
* Build, train, and evaluate a GAN model for face generation
* Understand the concept and implementation of reinforcement learning in R

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
linear_fits <- function(w, to_add = TRUE, line_type = 1) {curve(-w[1] /
w[2] * x - w[3] / w[2], xlim = c(-1, 2), ylim = c(-1, 2), col = "black",lty
= line_type, lwd = 2, xlab = "Input Value A", ylab = "Input Value B", add = to_add)}

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and deep learning developers who are familiar with machine learning and are looking to enhance their knowledge of deep learning using practical examples. Anyone interested in increasing the efficiency of their machine learning applications and exploring various options in R will also find this book useful. Basic knowledge of machine learning techniques and working knowledge of the R programming language is expected.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
